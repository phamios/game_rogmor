## Plot: generate the main characters

## Write the story

This process is really simple, I using the rule: `Small setps`.

> ðŸ¥¸ *Give me interaction between Kwasi and Dagna*

Kwasi and Dagna meet in a tavern, both seeking a good meal and a hot drink after a long day of traveling. Kwasi is sitting in a corner, keeping to himself and observing the other patrons, while Dagna is up at the bar, chatting with the bartender and enjoying a mug of ale.

As the night wears on, Kwasi overhears Dagna talking about her quest to vanquish a group of bandits who have been terrorizing a nearby village. Intrigued, he walks over and introduces himself.

Kwasi: "Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. I may have some information that could be of use to you."

Dagna: "Oh? And what information would that be?"

Kwasi: "I've been tracking these bandits for a while now. I know their hideout, and I could show you the way."

Dagna raises an eyebrow, suspicious of Kwasi's motives. But after a moment's consideration, she decides to take him up on his offer.

Dagna: "All right. Lead the way, then. I could use all the help I can get."

Kwasi nods, and the two of them head out into the night, ready to bring the bandits to justice.

> ðŸ¥¸ *Keep going the story when meet Brekkr*

As Kwasi and Dagna make their way to the bandits' hideout, they come across a lone figure on the road. It's Brekkr, a fearsome warrior from a nearby village, who has been tracking the same group of bandits.

Kwasi: "Hold on, who are you?"

Brekkr: "I'm Brekkr. And you two are not the only ones hunting these bandits. What's your business with them?"

Dagna: "We were hired to bring them to justice for their crimes in our village. And you?"

Brekkr: "I have my own reasons for seeking them out. But I'm not one to turn down extra help. Join forces with me, and together we'll take them down once and for all."

Kwasi and Dagna exchange a look, both feeling a sense of respect and fear for the warrior in front of them. They both agree to work together with Brekkr, forming a formidable trio.

As they continue their journey, they talk and share their stories, learning more about each other. They face challenges and overcome obstacles, honing their skills and becoming a well-oiled machine.

Finally, they reach the bandits' hideout, ready for a final showdown. The fight is intense, but in the end, they emerge victorious. The bandits are brought to justice, and Kwasi, Dagna, and Brekkr become known as the heroes who saved the village.

> ðŸ¥¸ *Finally the party will found the leader of bandits was Astrid, which was change the plans*

As Kwasi, Dagna, and Brekkr finally find the leader of the bandits, they are shocked to discover that it's Astrid, a former companion of theirs on their previous adventures.

Astrid: "Ha! I never expected to see you three here. What brings you to my humble abode?"

Brekkr: "We've come to bring you to justice, Astrid. You and your bandits have caused too much harm in our villages."

Astrid: "Justice? How naive of you, Brekkr. In this world, there is only power, and those who have it. And I have it now, with this band of loyal followers."

Kwasi: "Why, Astrid? What happened to you? We used to be friends."

Astrid: "Friends? You were just convenient allies, nothing more. When I saw the opportunity to gather power and resources, I took it. And now, I have everything I want."

Dagna: "We can't let you continue like this. It's not right."

Astrid: "Right or wrong, it doesn't matter. I have an army of followers, and you three are no match for us. Surrender now, or face the consequences."

The three heroes exchange a determined look, knowing that they can't let Astrid get away with her crimes. A fierce battle ensues, with both sides giving it their all. In the end, the heroes emerge victorious, capturing Astrid and putting an end to her reign of terror.

But the victory is bittersweet, as they realize the true extent of Astrid's corruption and the path she took. They make sure she is brought to justice, and work to restore peace to the affected villages. And although they can never fully forget their former friend's betrayal, they continue on their journey, always looking for the next adventure.
