# Terminal maded markdown file
> If remember the correct `shortkey` then my live is much more easier.

Maybe the terminal is not consume that amount of energy like VS code, which is somehow a littlebit slow.

KIRO editor maded by Rust, my question is why do not able to use OS cursor movement shortkeys like options-arrow-left and so on.

Hello this code maded by Kiro

The linux navigation sometime focus be confusing. May I can fork this application or work as contributor.
My drawing application inside of VS code is one of my really awesome idea, because all HTML based drawing application is too heavyweight.
But as Max mentioned to find a good name is essencal!

```javascript
// saddly thi editor are not know the markdown highlighting.

const foo = list.map(([a,b]) => [a, type b]).map(Object.fromEntry);
```

I also got this Macintosh give opportunity to use voice recogniser. 
Something wrong in my throat. But sure this voice control text input much more faster than a single keyboard. 
But doesn't so precise, like keyboard is.

The most importan shortkey is:
- jump to end of line
- undo
- redo
- clear to start of line
- copy
- paste
- duplicate the line
- mutli cursor editing
- open or switch to another file in project
- search
- replace
- jump to end of file
- jump to begin of file

> so it is seems very useful.

## Rogmor fact
This program already contain 680 LOC so is not big, as expected this complexity.

## TL;DR

`kiro` looks worth terminal
